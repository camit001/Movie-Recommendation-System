# Movie-Recommendation-System



A **Recommender System** is an intelligent system designed to predict or filter user preferences based on their choices. These systems are widely used across various domains, including movies, music, news, books, research articles, social media, and e-commerce products.  

### Types of Recommender Systems  
Recommender systems generate recommendations using two main approaches:  

1. **Collaborative Filtering**  
   - Builds a model based on a user's past behavior, such as previously watched movies or purchased items.  
   - Utilizes similar choices made by other users to predict preferences.  
   - Suggests items based on user interactions and patterns.  

2. **Content-Based Filtering**  
   - Uses item characteristics and user preferences to recommend similar content.  
   - Analyzes the features of previously liked items to suggest new ones.  
   - Recommendations are based solely on the user's past interactions.  

### Building a Basic Movie Recommendation System  
To implement a basic recommendation system, we will suggest movies that are most similar to a selected movie. This system provides recommendations based on content similarity, helping users discover movies aligned with their preferences.  

For this project, we have used the **YBI-Foundation Dataset**, which contains structured movie data. The implementation is done using **Python** and **Pandas**, leveraging data analysis techniques to identify and recommend movies similar to the user's choice.
